# Reusable Engineering Standards

The sections below are project-agnostic. Copy this block (everything below the `---` separator above) into any other project's `CLAUDE.md` unchanged to apply the same standards there.

## Code Style

**Never write comments.** No inline `//` comments, no `/* */` blocks, no javadoc, no leading explanatory headers on methods or fields. Code must be self-documenting through naming alone.

- Variable names describe what the value *is* (e.g. `armorCoveragePercent`, not `acp` with a comment).
- Method names describe what they *do* and under what conditions (e.g. `applyMultiplierIfAttackerIsPlayer`, not `applyBonus` with a comment explaining the player check).
- Extract a well-named helper method instead of writing a comment to explain a block.
- Constants get descriptive names that encode their meaning and unit (e.g. `KNIGHTMETAL_BONUS_DAMAGE_AT_FULL_ARMOR`, not `MAX` with a `// 2.0 vs fully-armored target` comment).
- If a name would need a comment to explain it, rename it until it doesn't.

Existing files may still contain comments and javadoc — leave them in place when editing unrelated code, but do not add new ones and prefer to delete obsolete ones when touching the surrounding code.

**Never leave dead code.** No unused methods, fields, classes, parameters, or imports. No "escape hatch" or "just in case" code. No commented-out blocks. If it's not called, delete it — the git history is the archive.

## Code Review

When asked to review code, do a "pass", check for issues, or otherwise audit a recent change, do **two** passes in order:

1. **Self-audit first.** Read the diff yourself. Fix the obvious — dead code, comments, naming, anything that violates the Code Style rules above. Report findings.
2. **Then spawn an independent reviewer** via the `/code-review` skill or a fresh agent. Give it only the diff and the goal, no context about why you made the choices you did. That catches the bugs you would otherwise rationalize away.

Don't skip step 2 because step 1 looked clean — the value of the independent reviewer is exactly that it doesn't share your blind spots.
